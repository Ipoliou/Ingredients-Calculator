# INGREDIENTS CALCULATOR

This programme takes meal names in input and outputs the list of ingredients (with their quantity) that are required to make those meals. If an ingredient is present in several meals, quantities for that ingredient are added up.  
  
The meals are specified in the `.txt` file. New meals can therefore be removed or added.  

## Execution

```
$ python3 main.py
```
